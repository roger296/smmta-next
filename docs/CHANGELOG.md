# Changelog

Non-trivial bugs found and fixed during the storefront prompt sequence
(see `buldmeawebstore.md` in the project workspace). Trivia (typos, missing
imports, lint nits) is omitted.

## Prompt 1 — extend product schema for groups and storefront content

- Fixed pre-existing referenced-but-not-installed `pino-pretty` (transport target in `apps/api/src/app.ts`). Added it as an `apps/api` devDependency so the dev server boots and tests that build the Fastify app run.
- Caught early during Prompt 1 testing: the seed script's CLI-entry guard used `import.meta.url.includes('seed-storefront')` which is always true (the filename is in the URL). When the test imported `seedStorefront`, the CLI block ran, closed the DB pool, and left subsequent test calls with an ended pool. Replaced with a strict `fileURLToPath(import.meta.url) === process.argv[1]` check.
